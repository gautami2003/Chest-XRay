# Chest-XRay

### Summary:
Our project focuses on developing a deep learning model for chest X-ray image classification using the VGG16 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia categories, aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosing respiratory conditions. We leverage transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuning it for our specific classification task. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

### Implementation Steps on GitHub:

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Obtain the chest X-ray dataset from the provided source.
   - Link(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
   - Organize the dataset into training and testing directories, with subdirectories for each class (normal and pneumonia).

3. **Model Architecture:**
   - Define the VGG16 architecture and add custom classification layers for chest X-ray classification.
   - Freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent them from being retrained.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
   - Train the model using the training data, monitoring validation performance over epochs.
   - Save the trained model to a file for future use.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its performance.
   - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize model performance using ROC curve, precision-recall curve, confusion matrix, and calibration curve.

6. **Results and Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations of training and validation loss/accuracy curves.
   - Showcase sample predictions and class-wise metrics to demonstrate model performance.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the project details, including objectives, methodologies, and key findings.
   - Provide a step-by-step guide for replicating the project and using the trained model.
   - Include sample code snippets and explanations to facilitate understanding and usage.

8. **Contributing:**
   - Encourage contributions from the community by providing guidelines for reporting issues, submitting pull requests, and contributing to the project's development.

By following these implementation steps and providing comprehensive documentation, users can easily replicate the project, understand its components, and leverage the trained model for their own applications.
